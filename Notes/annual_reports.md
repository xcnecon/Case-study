p.10 To what extent is the collaboration between family farm and VITL an edge? Can other firms capture the relationships? Will there be monopoly legal issues? How difficult is it to establish a familiy farm that fits VITL standard? How does the profit sharing profile look like? 

p.11 So far there is only one central processing station (Missouriand) but they plan to build another one that will be fully operational by 2027 (Indiana). 

p.12 Some numbers: Total U.S. Shell market retail sales: $12.5 billion. Household penertration: 9.2%. 

p.14 "Expand Our Portfolio" hints expansion beyond egg. 

p.15 Blue eggs.

p.16 54% of the pasture-raised retail egg segment. future growth seems to rely on segment growth rather than increasing market share. 

Factors that affects earnings: prices and availability of feed grains, and cost of laying hens. So far as I know, VITL does not pay family farm suppliers based on the wholesale egg price, but rather based on cost + markup. This is why when egg price flucates so much in the flue cycle, their profit margin remains stable. This means that if such a scenario occurs: cost of feed grain increases a lot but egg price remains low, their margin will get hurt considerably. 

p.25 hints high capex in the future

p.57 Business model: "Weprimarily work with our farms pursuant to buy-sell contracts." Farmers are responsible for all the working capital and investment to produce eggs and manage the farm. But they are also paying farms in advance so that they can start production. "These costs are expected to be recognized over the term of the related buy-sell contracts with the new farms, which are generally four to five years in length." OK this is interesting. "We are contractually obligated to purchase all of the eggs produced by the farmer during the term of the contract at an
 agreed-upon price that depends upon pallet weight and is adjusted quarterly for changes in feed cost."

 p.57 the central station can process 6 million eggs a day. 

 p.58 "In fiscal 2024 and continuing into fiscal 2025, HPAI-related disruptions in the supply of conventional eggs resulted at times in increased demand for premium egg products such as ours, which occasionally resulted in shortages of these eggs on shelves at our retail customers. " Yeah but for what reason. My guess is that this is driven by the narrowing spread between VITL's egg price and conventional egg price. You should expect the spread to widen and cut into demand recently. 

 p.73 Auditor report: Unqualified opinion but weak internal control over finnacial reporting, " there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companyâ€™s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis".
