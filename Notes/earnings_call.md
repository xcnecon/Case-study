2025Q2:

Regarding the recent price hike: price elasticity is better than expected. 

In the last five years, more or less capacity or supply constrained. 

Regarding the capex guidence increase from 50-60 mil to 100-110 mil: "Thanks, Jon. So as we said in the prepared remarks, so much of that decision is rooted in a desire to kind of catch up to the growth that we've generated with this powerful brand over the last 5-plus years." Be careful that your performamnce in the last two years has enjoyed a huge tailwind with HPAI. 

Analst said the price gap with other pastured raise eggs increased a bit but not a lot after the price hike. 

Why they raised the price: they expected high unit cost from tariff which did not come true. This furthur indicate that they operate a cost+markup model, with the gross magrin being about 35%. 

An answer from Thilo Wrede indicates that VITL sells both organic and conventional pasture raised eggs. And the growth from mix is about selling more organic ones which have higher ASP. In 2025Q2 VITL has also been selling more eggs to retail than wholesale channel which is another mix effect. This also indicates that they are probali indeed supply constraint that a shift in composition of channel can increase sales. 

Prefer to increase inventory for egg from 1 week to 2-3 weeks.

Price of commodity eggs has very little impact on the business. Really? 

ASPs are under $10 in most cases

Need another 500 farms to support supply for the new ECS in Indiana
