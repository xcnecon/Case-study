ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

      The Company is primarily engaged in the production,  cleaning,  grading,
packing  and sale of fresh shell eggs.  The  Company's  fiscal year end is the
Saturday closest to May 31.

      The Company's  operations  are fully  integrated.  At its  facilities it
hatches chicks, grows pullets, manufactures feed, and produces, processes, and
distributes  shell eggs.  The Company  currently  is the largest  producer and
distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United  States.  Shell eggs account for
98% of the Company's net sales. The Company  primarily  markets its shell eggs
in the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the
United  States.  Shell eggs are sold  directly  by the  Company  primarily  to
national and regional supermarket chains.

      The Company  currently uses contract  producers for approximately 22% of
its total egg production. Contract producers operate under agreements with the
Company for the use of their  facilities  in the  production  of shell eggs by
layers owned by the Company,  which owns the eggs produced.  Also,  shell eggs
are purchased from outside producers for resale, as needed, by the Company.

      The  Company's  operating  income or loss is  significantly  affected by
wholesale shell egg market prices,  which can fluctuate widely and are outside
of the Company's  control.  Retail sales of shell eggs are greatest during the
fall and winter months and lowest during the summer  months.  Prices for shell
eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal  factors and a natural  increase in egg
production during the spring and early summer.

      The Company's  cost of production is materially  affected by feed costs,
which average about 60% of Cal-Maine's total farm egg production cost. Changes
in feed costs result in changes in the Company's  cost of goods sold. The cost
of feed  ingredients is affected by a number of supply and demand factors such
as crop production and weather, and other factors,  such as the level of grain
exports, over which the Company has little or no control.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

      The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items
from the Company's Condensed  Consolidated  Statements of Operations expressed
as a percentage of net sales.

      NET SALES

      Net sales for the first  quarter of fiscal 2001 were $75.5  million,  an
increase of $16.4  million,  or 27.9%,  as  compared  to the first  quarter of
fiscal 2000.  Total eggs sold increased in the current quarter and egg selling
prices  increased  as  compared  with  prices a year ago.  Dozens sold for the
current  quarter were 131.3 million dozen,  an increase of 22.0 million dozen,
or 20.1%,  as  compared  to the first  quarter of last year.  The  increase in
dozens sold is mostly due to the  purchase of Smith Farms in  September  1999.
The  Company's  net average  selling price per dozen for the fiscal 2001 first
quarter was $.546,  compared to $.493 for the first  quarter of last year,  an
increase of 10.8%.  The Company's net average selling is the blended price for
all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including  non-graded egg sales,  breaking
stock and undergrades.  Although  domestic demand for eggs was good and export
demand  improved,  the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year is usually a
weak quarter as to egg price and volume of sales.

      COST OF SALES

      Total cost of sales for the first  quarter  ended  September 2, 2000 was
$67.6 million, an increase of $10.3 million, or 18.0%, as compared to the cost
of sales of $57.3 million for last year's first  quarter.  The increase is due
to the  20.1%  increase  in  dozens  sold in the  current  quarter.  Feed cost
remained  about the same as last  year.  Feed  cost per dozen for the  quarter
ended  September  2,  2000 was  $.186,  compared  to $.184  per  dozen for the
comparable  fiscal 2000 first quarter.  Other operating costs also remained in
the same ranges for both the current and last year first fiscal  quarter.  The
increases  in dozens  sold and  improved  egg  selling  prices  resulted in an
increase in gross  profit from 2.9% for the quarter  ended  August 28, 1999 to
10.4% of net sales for the current quarter ended September 2, 2000.

      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

      Selling,  general and administrative expense for the first quarter ended
September 2, 2000 was $10.1 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or 11.2%, as
compared to the expense of $9.1 million for the  comparable  period last year.
The  increase  is due to  increased  payroll  and  related  expenses  from the
acquisition  of Smith Farms in September  1999 and due to  increased  delivery
costs from the increased dozens sold. On a cost per dozen sold basis, selling,
general  and  administrative  expense  decreased  from $.083 per dozen for the
first quarter of fiscal 2000 to $.077 per dozen for the  comparable  period of
fiscal 2001, a decrease of $.006 per dozen sold,  or 7.2%. As a percent of net
sales,  selling,  general and administrative  expense decreased from 15.4% for
fiscal 2000 to 13.4% for the current fiscal year.

      OPERATING LOSS

      As the  result of the  above,  an  operating  loss of $2.2  million  was
incurred for the first  quarter  ended  September  2, 2000,  as compared to an
operating  loss of $7.4  million for last fiscal  year's first  quarter.  As a
percent of sales,  the current fiscal 2001 quarter had a 3.0% operating  loss,
compared to an operating loss of 12.5% for last year.

      OTHER EXPENSE

      Other  expenses for the first quarter ended  September 2, 2000 were $1.8
million,  compared to $1.1 million for last year's first quarter.  The current
quarter  increase of $700,000 is due to an increase in net interest expense of
$1.1 million and an increase in other income of $400,000. Net interest expense
increased as the result of increased  borrowing in fiscal 2000. Long and short
term debt at  September  2, 2000 was  $135.4  million,  as  compared  to $90.3
million at August 28, 1999. Other income increased primarily from an insurance
claim pertaining to fire damage at a production and processing facility.  As a
percent of net sales,  other expense increased from 1.9% for last year's first
quarter to 2.4% for the current first quarter.

      INCOME TAXES

      As a result of the above, the Company had a pre-tax loss of $4.1 million
for the quarter  ended  September  2, 2000,  compared to pre-tax  loss of $8.5
million for the quarter ended August 28, 1999.  For the current first quarter,
an income tax benefit of $1.5 million was recorded  with an effective tax rate
of 35.7%,  as  compared  to an income  tax  benefit  of $3.1  million  with an
effective tax rate of 36.9% for last year's first quarter.

      NET LOSS

      As a result  of the  above,  the net loss for the  first  quarter  ended
September  2, 2000 was $2.6  million,  or $.22 per basic  and  diluted  share,
compared to net loss of $5.4 million,  or $.43 per basic and diluted share for
the quarter ended August 28, 1999.

      CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

      The  Company's  working  capital at September 2, 2000 was $13.9  million
compared to $18.5  million at June 3, 2000.  The  Company's  current ratio was
1.22 at September 2, 2000 as compared with 1.36 at June 3, 2000. The Company's
need for working  capital  generally  is highest in the last and first  fiscal
quarters ending in May and August, respectively,  when egg prices are normally
at seasonal lows.  Seasonal borrowing needs frequently are higher during these
quarters  than during other fiscal  quarters.  The Company has a $35.0 million
line of credit  with three banks of which $17.5  million  was  outstanding  at
September  2,  2000.  The  Company's  long-term  debt at  September  2,  2000,
including  current  maturities,  amounted  to $117.9  million,  as compared to
$119.7 million at June 3, 2000.

      For the thirteen weeks ended September 2, 2000, $377,000 in net cash was
used in operating  activities.  This compares to net cash used of $8.7 million
for the comparable  period last year. In the current fiscal quarter,  $665,000
was used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, $297,000 was received
from sales of property,  and $3.0 million used for construction  projects. Net
cash  of  $2.7  million  was  used  for  additions  to  notes  receivable  and
investments.  Approximately $163,000 was used for purchase of common stock for
the treasury and $154,000  used for payments of dividends on the common stock.
Additional  borrowings  of $10.0  million was  received on the note payable to
bank,  and $1.8 million was used for  repayments  on long-term  debt.  The net
result of these  current  activities  was an increase in cash of $1.6  million
since June 3, 2000.

      In the first  quarter  ended August 28, 1999,  $2.4 million was used for
purchases  of  property,  plant,  and  equipment,  and $2.7  million  used for
construction projects.  Approximately $487,000 was used for purchase of common
stock and $154,000 used for dividend payments. Additional long-term borrowings
of $7.4 million were received and  repayments  of $847,000 were made.  The net
result was a decrease of $8.0  million in cash from May 29, 1999 to August 28,
1999.

      Certain key industry  indicators for shell eggs are currently  favorable
for fiscal 2001.  Baby chicks placed during the first eight months of calendar
2000 are down over 5% compared to the same period last year. This will tend to
reduce the nationwide laying flock size in the year ahead. Current projections
for total laying flock size in the U. S. during the Company's  fiscal 2001 are
only slightly larger than last fiscal year. With  anticipated  improved demand
by the egg  industry,  this should result in higher  selling  prices for eggs.
Current  industry  indications  are for a good corn and soybean crop for 2000.
This should ensure favorable cost of feed for the current fiscal year.

      Substantially  all trade  receivables and inventories  collateralize the
Company's line of credit, and property,  plant and equipment collateralize the
Company's  long-term  debt.  The Company is required by certain  provisions of
these loan  agreements to (1) maintain  minimum levels of working  capital and
net worth; (2) limit dividends,  capital  expenditures,  lease obligations and
additional  long-term  borrowings;   and  (3)  maintain  various  current  and
cash-flow  coverage  ratios,  among other  restrictions.  At June 3, 2000, the
Company  did not meet  certain  of  these  provisions  on its  line of  credit
agreement and  substantially all of its long-term debt agreements and obtained
amendments  to the loan  agreements or waivers of these  requirements  through
fiscal 2001.  As of  September 2, 2000,  the Company did not meet one of these
provisions on one loan  agreement  and received a waiver on the covenant.  The
Company is in  compliance  with the amended or waived  provisions  of all loan
agreements.  Under certain of the loan agreements, the lenders have the option
to require the  prepayment  of any  outstanding  borrowings  in the event of a
change in the control of the Company.

      At    September    2,   2000   the   Company   had   $9.6   million   in
construction-in-progress  which primarily represents construction of new shell
egg production and processing facilities in Waelder,  Tesas and a feed mill in
Chase,  Kansas.  The estimated  cost to complete  construction  of the Waelder
facility and Chase feed mill in fiscal 2001 is approximately $3.4 million. The
Company has a commitment from an insurance company to receive $13.4 million in
long-term borrowings applicable to the Waelder facility, of which $4.8 million
was funded as of  September  2, 2000.  In  addition to the  completion  of the
Waelder  facility  and Chase feed mill,  the  Company  has  projected  capital
expenditures  of $15.0  million in fiscal  2001,  which will be funded by cash
flows from operations and additional long-term borrowings.

      As part of the Smith Farms  purchase in September  1999,  the Company is
continuing the  construction  of egg  production and processing  facilities in
Searcy,  Arkansas  and  Flatonia,  Texas.  The  projects are being funded by a
leasing  company.  Total cost of the Searcy  facility is  approximately  $20.0
million and  completion is expected in the last quarter of fiscal 2001.  Total
cost of the Flatonia facility is approximately $16.0 million and completion is
anticipated in the second  quarter of fiscal 2002.  These  facilities  will be
leased with seven year terms and accounted for as operating leases.
