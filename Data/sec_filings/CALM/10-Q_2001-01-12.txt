ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENTS'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

      The Company is primarily engaged in the production,  cleaning,  grading,
packing,  and sale of fresh shell eggs.  The Company's  fiscal year end is the
Saturday closest to May 31.

      The Company's  operations are fully  integrated.  It owns  facilities to
hatch chicks,  grow  pullets,  manufacture  feed,  and produce,  process,  and
distribute  shell eggs.  The Company  currently  is the largest  producer  and
distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United  States.  The shell eggs account
for 98% of the Company's net sales.  The Company  primarily  markets its shell
eggs in the southwestern,  southeastern,  mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions
of the United States. Shell eggs are sold directly by the Company primarily to
national and regional supermarket chains.

      The Company  currently uses contract  producers for approximately 20% of
its total egg production. Contract producers operate under agreements with the
Company for the use of their  facilities  in the  production  of shell eggs by
layers owned by the Company,  which owns the eggs produced.  Also,  shell eggs
are purchased, as needed, from outside producers for resale by the Company.

      The  Company's  operating  income or loss is  significantly  affected by
wholesale shell egg market prices,  which can fluctuate widely and are outside
of the Company's  control.  Retail sales of shell eggs are greatest during the
fall and winter months and lowest during the summer  months.  Prices for shell
eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal  factors and a natural  increase in egg
production during the spring and early summer.

      The Company's  cost of production is materially  affected by feed costs,
which  average  about 60% of  Cal-Maine's'  total  farm egg  production  cost.
Changes in feed costs result in changes in the  Company's  cost of goods sold.
The cost of feed  ingredients  is  affected  by a number of supply  and demand
factors such as crop  production and weather,  and other factors,  such as the
level of grain exports, over which the Company has little or no control.

NET SALES

      Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2001 were $92.6  million,  an
increase of $21.5 million,  or 30.3% as compared to net sales of $71.1 million
for the second quarter of fiscal 2000.  Total dozens of eggs sold increased in
the current  quarter and egg selling prices  increased as compared with prices
last year.  Dozens sold for the current  quarter were 137.1 million dozen,  an
increase of 5.3 million  dozen,  or 4.1% as compared to the second  quarter of
last year.  Improved demand for eggs and less supply resulted in substantially
higher egg  selling  prices  during the current  quarter.  The  Company's  net
average  selling price per dozen for the fiscal 2001 second quarter was $.644,
compared to $.500 for the second quarter of last year, an increase of 28.8%.

      Net sales for the  twenty-six  weeks ended  December 2, 2000 were $168.1
million,  an increase of $38.0 million,  or 29.2%. As in the current  quarter,
total dozens sold and net egg selling  prices  increased.  Dozens sold for the
current  26-week  period were 268.4  million as compared to 241.1  million for
last fiscal year, an increase of 11.3%.  Approximately half of the increase in
dozens sold is due to an acquisition  made during the second quarter of fiscal
2000.  As discussed  above,  favorable  egg market  conditions  increased  egg
selling  prices.  For the current 26 week period,  the  Company's  net average
selling  price per dozen was $.596,  compared to $.498 per dozen last year, an
increase of $.098 per dozen, or 19.7%.

COST OF SALES

      Total cost of sales for the second  quarter  ended  December 2, 2000 was
$74.3 million, an increase of $10.0 million, or 15.4%, as compared to the cost
of sales of $64.4 million for last year's second quarter.  The increase is due
to increases in dozens sold, cost of purchases from outside egg producers, and
cost of feed  ingredients.  Dozens of eggs sold  increased 5.3 million for the
current quarter.  These additional dozens were produced in Company facilities.
The increase in the cost of eggs purchased  from outside  producers was due to
improved  egg  market  conditions.  Feed  cost for the  second  quarter  ended
December 2, 2000 was $.194 per dozen,  compared to last fiscal year's cost per
dozen of $.179, an increase of 8.4%. The increases in dozens sold and improved
egg selling  prices  resulted in an increase in gross profit from 9.4% for the
quarter ended November 27, 1999 to 19.8% of net sales for the current  quarter
ended December 2, 2000.

      For the  twenty-six  week period ended  December 2, 2000,  total cost of
sales was $141.9 million,  an increase of $20.2 million, or 16.6%, as compared
to the cost of sales of $121.7  million for last year. As in the quarter,  the
increase in cost of sales is the result of more dozens  sold,  higher  outside

egg purchase cost, and moderate  increase in cost of feed. Eggs sold increased
27.3  million  dozen  in  the  current  year  and  were  supplied  by  Company
facilities.  Of  this  increase  in  dozens,  approximately  half is due to an
acquisition last year. Feed cost for the current 26 weeks was $.191 per dozen,
compared  to $.179  per  dozen  for  last  year,  an  increase  of  6.7%.  The
improvements  in egg selling  prices and increased  dozens sold resulted in an
increase in gross profit from 6.5% of net sales for last year to 15.6% for the
current fiscal year.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

      Selling, general and administrative expense for the second quarter ended
December  2, 2000 was $10.4  million,  an increase of  $800,000,  or 8.3%,  as
compared to $9.6 million for last fiscal  year's second  quarter.  Most of the
increase was in delivery costs from  increased  dozens sold and from increased
fuel cost and outside contract  trucking.  Fuel cost has increased 27.0% above
last year's quarter and is a cause of the increased  outside contract trucking
cost.  On a cost per dozen sold basis,  selling,  general  and  administrative
expense  remained about the same,  $.076 per dozen for the current  quarter as
compared to $.073 for last year. As a percent of net sales,  selling,  general
and administrative expense decreased from 13.5% for fiscal 2000 second quarter
to 11.3% for the current quarter.

      For the twenty-six  weeks ended December 2, 2000,  selling,  general and
administrative  expense was $20.6  million,  an increase of $1.9  million,  or
10.2%,  as  compared  to an expense of $18.7  million for the same period last
fiscal year. As in the current  quarter,  most of the increase was in delivery
cost,  which  increased  due to an increase of 11.3% in dozens sold and higher
delivery costs. For the current period, fuel cost has increased 33.0% from the
same period in the prior year and has also increased outside contract trucking
cost.  On a cost per dozen sold basis,  selling,  general  and  administrative
expense  is  unchanged  at $.077 for both  fiscal  years.  As a percent of net
sales,  selling,  general and administrative  expense has decreased from 14.4%
for fiscal 2000 to 12.3% for the current fiscal year.


OPERATING INCOME

      As the result of the above,  operating  income was $7.9  million for the
second  quarter ended  December 2, 2000,  as compared to an operating  loss of
$2.9 million for last year's fiscal second quarter. As a percent of net sales,
the current  fiscal 2001 quarter had an 8.5% operating  income,  compared to a
4.1% operating loss for last year.

         For the twenty-six weeks ended December 2, 2000, operating income was
$5.6 million,  compared to an operating  loss of $10.3 million for last fiscal
year.  As a  percent  of net  sales,  the  current  fiscal  period  had a 3.3%
operating income, compared to a 7.9% operating loss for last year.

OTHER EXPENSE

      Other  expense for the second  quarter  ended  December 2, 2000 was $1.3
million, the same amount as last year's comparable period. This net figure for
the current  quarter was the result of an increase of $739,000 in net interest
expense  and an  $815,000  increase  in other  income.  Net  interest  expense
increased as the result of  increased  borrowing,  primarily on the  Company's
line of  credit,  which  began  during  the  second  quarter  of fiscal  2000,
increased  through the first quarter of fiscal 2001 and  decreased  during the
current second quarter.  Other income for the current  quarter  increased from
equity in income of affiliates and from settlement of an insurance claim. As a
percent of net sales,  other  expense was 1.4% for the current  fiscal  second
quarter, compared to 1.9% last year.

      For the twenty-six  weeks ended December 2, 2000, other expense was $3.1
million, an increase of $600,000,  or 24.0%, as compared to an expense of $2.5
million for last year. For the current period,  net interest expense increased
$1.9  million  and other  income  increased  $1.3  million.  The net  increase
resulted from the same activities as mentioned  above in the current  quarter.
As a percent of net sales,  other expense was 1.8% for the current period,  as
compared to 1.9% for last year.

      As a result of the above, the Company's  pre-tax income was $6.6 million
for the quarter  ended  December 2, 2000,  compared to a pre-tax  loss of $4.3
million  for last  year's  quarter.  For the  current  quarter,  an income tax
expense of $2.4 million was recorded with an effective  tax rate of 36.0%,  as
compared to an income tax benefit of $1.5 million  with an  effective  rate of

last year. For the current  twenty-six  week period,  an income tax expense of
$900,000 was recorded with an effective  tax rate of 36.5%,  as compared to an
income tax benefit of $4.7 million  with an  effective  rate of 36.7% for last
year's comparable period.


NET INCOME (LOSS)

      Net  income  for the  second  quarter  ended  December  2, 2000 was $4.2
million,  or $.35 per basic share,  compared to net loss of $2.7  million,  or
$.22 per basic share for last fiscal year's second quarter.

      For the  twenty-six  week period ended  December 2, 2000, net income was
$1.6 million, or $.13 per basic share, compared to last fiscal year's net loss
of $8.1 million, or $.65 per basic share.


CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

      The  Company's  working  capital at December  2, 2000 was $21.1  million
compared to $18.5  million at June 3, 2000.  The  Company's  current ratio was
1.35 at December 2, 2000 as compared with 1.36 at June 3, 2000.  The Company's
need for working  capital  generally  is highest in the last and first  fiscal
quarters ending in May and August, respectively,  when egg prices are normally
at seasonal lows.  Seasonal borrowing needs frequently are higher during these
quarters  than during other fiscal  quarters.  The Company has a $35.0 million
line of credit  with three banks of which $10.0  million  was  outstanding  at
December 2, 2000. The Company's long-term debt at December 2, 2000,  including
current maturities,  amounted to $119.3 million, as compared to $119.7 million
at June 3, 2000.

      For the  twenty-six  weeks ended  December 2, 2000,  $8.2 million in net
cash was provided by operating activities.  This compares to $9.1 million that
was used in operating  activities for the comparable  period last fiscal year.
In the current twenty-six week period,  $1.3 million was used for purchases of
property,  plant and equipment,  $500,000 net proceeds  received from sales of
property,  plant  and  equipment,  and  $5.0  million  used  for  construction
projects.  Net cash of $3.0 million was used for additions to notes receivable
and investments.  Approximately $678,000 was used for purchase of common stock
for the  treasury  and  $291,000  used for payments of dividends on the common
stock.  Additional  cash of $2.5  million was  received on the note payable to
bank and,  additional  long-term  borrowings  of $2.9 million  were  received.
Repayments of $3.3 million were made on long-term  debt. The net result was an
increase in cash of approximately $549,000.

      For the comparable period last year, $1.6 million was used for purchases
of property, plant and equipment, $9.5 million used for construction projects,
and $36.2 million used in acquisition  of a shell egg operation.  Net payments
of  approximately  $400,000 were received on notes receivable and investments.
Approximately $567,000 was used for purchase of common stock, and $303,000 was
used for payments of dividends on the common  stock.  Additional  cash of $7.5
million was received on the note  payable to bank,  and  additional  long-term
borrowings  of $23.5  million were  received.  Repayments of $2.5 million were
made on  long-term  debt.  The net  result  was a  decrease  in cash of  $28.4
million.

      Certain key industry  indicators for shell eggs are currently  favorable
for  fiscal  2001.  Baby  chicks  placed  during  calendar  2000 are down over
approximately  5% compared  to the same  period  last year.  This will tend to
reduce  the  nationwide  laying  flock  size  in  the  current  year.  Current
projections  for total  laying  flock size in the U. S.  during the  Company's
fiscal 2001 are only slightly larger than last fiscal year.  With  anticipated
improved  demand by the egg  industry,  this should  result in higher  selling
prices for eggs. Current industry  indications are for a good corn and soybean
supply for 2001.  This should  ensure  favorable  cost of feed for the current
fiscal year.

      Substantially  all trade  receivables and inventories  collateralize the
Company's line of credit, and property,  plant and equipment collateralize the
Company's  long-term  debt.  The Company is required by certain  provisions of
these loan  agreements to (1) maintain  minimum levels of working  capital and
net worth; (2) limit dividends,  capital  expenditures,  lease obligations and
additional  long-term  borrowings;   and  (3)  maintain  various  current  and
cash-flow  coverage  ratios,  among  other  restrictions.  The  Company was in
compliance with these  provisions as of December 2, 2000. Under certain of the
loan agreements,  the lenders have the option to require the prepayment of any
outstanding borrowings in the event of a change in the control of the Company.

      At   December    2,   2000   the    Company   had   $3.3    million   in
construction-in-progress  which primarily represents construction of new shell
egg production and processing facilities in Waelder, Texas. The estimated cost
to  complete   construction  of  the  Waelder   facility  in  fiscal  2001  is
approximately  $3.4  million.  The Company has a commitment  from an insurance
company to receive  $13.4  million in long-term  borrowings  applicable to the
Waelder  facility,  of which $11.4  million was funded as of December 2, 2000.
Including the  completion of the Waelder  facility,  the Company has projected
capital  expenditures of $15.0 million in fiscal 2001, which will be funded by
cash flows from operations and additional long-term borrowings.

      As part of the Smith Farms  purchase in September  1999,  the Company is
continuing the  construction  of egg  production and processing  facilities in
Searcy,  Arkansas  and  Flatonia,  Texas.  The  projects are being funded by a
leasing  company.  Total cost of the Searcy  facility is  approximately  $20.0
million and completion is expected in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.  Total
cost of the Flatonia facility is approximately $16.0 million and completion is
anticipated in the second  quarter of fiscal 2002.  These  facilities  will be
leased with seven year terms and accounted for as operating leases.
